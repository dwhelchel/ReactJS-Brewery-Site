## Dakota's Brewery Directory

My brewery directory is a front-end web application built using React. The application includes three navigation pages (Home, directory, about). 
In the directory page, all breweries throughout the united states are displayed. If the user wishes to target a specific state, city, name, or type of brewery,
he/she need simply fill out the form.

### Motivation

When I turned the age of 21, my dad started to bring me to craft breweries to spend time together. I instantly loved the culture and art of craft beers. I wanted to practice my skills in front-end development with react, so I searched up a list of public APIs to use. To my luck, the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org)
caught my eye almost immediately.
